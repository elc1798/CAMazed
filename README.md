# CAMazed

This Processing application is supposed to use a webcam and detect a maze. The
program is then supposed to solve the maze and display the solution on top of
the webcam image.

The project is incomplete because it does not function properly.

## Ethan

+ A-Star Maze Solver
+ Maze Detection

## Joseph

+ Color setter
+ Solution drawing

The maze is detected and is solved, but the algorithm is slightly flawed and
needs to be improved. Solution drawing does not work.
